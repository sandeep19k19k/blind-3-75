part-3

contains duplicate

using set is important.(instead of list)

bcoz avg case search is O(1), 

iterate once to check ,if that is already present in created set.

if yes,return True.

else,return False.

Time complexity: O(n)

Space complexity: O(n) in worst case. i.e repetition occurs at last index.
